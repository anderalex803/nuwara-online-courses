# Week 4. Mathematical Application in Computer Vision

## Linear Algebra
* Least squares for image matching from multiple different photographs from different cameras portraying the same object
* Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): transformation from 2D image to 3D image

## Algorithms
* Dynamic programming for stereo matching and steam carving
* Graph algorithms for image segmentation and binary image restoration
