"Step 1. Instantiate an ML model: DecisionTree"

# Import train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Set SEED for reproducibility
SEED = 1

# Split the data into 70% train and 30% test
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=SEED)

# Instantiate a DecisionTreeRegressor dt
dt = DecisionTreeRegressor(min_samples_leaf=0.26, max_depth=4, random_state=SEED)

"Step 2. Compute Root Mean Squared error mean from CV"

from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Compute the array containing the 10-folds CV MSEs
MSE_CV_scores = - cross_val_score(dt, X_train, y_train, cv=10, 
                       scoring='neg_mean_squared_error',
                       n_jobs=-1)

# Compute the 10-folds CV RMSE
RMSE_CV = (MSE_CV_scores.mean())**(1/2)

# Print RMSE_CV
print('CV RMSE: {:.2f}'.format(RMSE_CV))

"Step 3. Compute RMSE of the train set"

# Import mean_squared_error from sklearn.metrics as MSE
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error as MSE

# Fit dt to the training set
dt.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the labels of the training set
y_pred_train = dt.predict(X_train)

# Evaluate the training set RMSE of dt
RMSE_train = (MSE(y_train, y_pred_train))**(1/2)

# Print RMSE_train
print('Train RMSE: {:.2f}'.format(RMSE_train))

"Step 4. Decide if it has high variance or high bias"
