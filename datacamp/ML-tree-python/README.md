# Key Lessons from Course Tree-Models in Python

## Decision Tree

* Terms in decision tree: feature `f`, split point `sp`. Its anatomy is defined by root, node, and leaf.
* The aim of decision tree is to maximize the Information Gain `IG`
* The hyperparameter is the `criterion` (e.g. `gini` or `entropy`) and the `maximum depth` (like in hierarchial clustering)
* Decision tree is used for both **classification** (as a classifier) and **regression** (as regressor)
