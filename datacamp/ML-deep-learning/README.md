# Key Lessons of course Introduction to Deep Learning in Python

* Use of gradient descent to update the weight and minimize the error (`predicted - actual`)
* **Backpropagation** for optimization. The time it takes to go through back prop equals to the time it takes to go through forward prop before (e.g. if we had through 4 iterations of back prop, we must have been through 4 forward prop)
