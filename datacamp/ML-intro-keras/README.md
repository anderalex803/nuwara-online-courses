# Introduction of Deep Learning with Keras

* Regression: see `01_NN_for_regression.py`. Case described: predicting orbit trajectory with meteorite strike
* Binary classification: see `02_NN_for_binary_classification.py` Case described: identifying fake and real banknotes (features: skewness, kurtosis, entropy)
