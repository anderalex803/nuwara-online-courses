# Key Lessons from couse Linear Classifiers in Python

* The theory behind the **decision boundary** of linear classifiers (logistic regression and SVC): `raw model output = coefficient * X_test + intercept`. If the result is negative, it predicts the data into one class (`0`), if positive it predicts to another class `1`. This `0` and `1` class are associated with the `y_test`
